# # Introduction #
# 
# In this exercise, youâ€™ll learn how to improve training outcomes by including an early stopping callback to prevent overfitting.
# 
# When you're ready, run this next cell to set everything up!

# Setup plotting
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')

       titleweight='bold', titlesize=18, titlepad=10)

# First load the *Spotify* dataset. Your task will be to predict the popularity of a song based on various audio features, like `'tempo'`, `'danceability'`, and `'mode'`.

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder

from tensorflow.keras import callbacks

spotify = pd.read_csv('../input/dl-course-data/spotify.csv')

X = spotify.copy().dropna()
y = X.pop('track_popularity')

features_num = ['danceability', 'energy', 'key', 'loudness', 'mode',
                'speechiness', 'acousticness', 'instrumentalness',

    (StandardScaler(), features_num),
    (OneHotEncoder(), features_cat),

# We'll do a "grouped" split to keep all of an artist's songs in one
# split or the other. This is to help prevent signal leakage.

    splitter = GroupShuffleSplit(train_size=train_size)

# Let's start with the simplest network, a linear model. This model has low capacity.
# 
# Run this next cell without any changes to train a linear model on the *Spotify* dataset.

# In[3]:


model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(1, input_shape=input_shape),
])
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='mae',
)
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),
    batch_size=512,
    epochs=50,
    verbose=0, # suppress output since we'll plot the curves
)
history_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)
history_df.loc[0:, ['loss', 'val_loss']].plot()
print("Minimum Validation Loss: {:0.4f}".format(history_df['val_loss'].min()));


# It's not uncommon for the curves to follow a "hockey stick" pattern like you see here. This makes the final part of training hard to see, so let's start at epoch 10 instead:

# In[4]:


# Start the plot at epoch 10
history_df.loc[10:, ['loss', 'val_loss']].plot()
print("Minimum Validation Loss: {:0.4f}".format(history_df['val_loss'].min()));


# # 1) Evaluate Baseline
# 
# What do you think? Would you say this model is underfitting, overfitting, just right?

# In[5]:


# View the solution (Run this cell to receive credit!)
q_1.check()


# Now let's add some capacity to our network. We'll add three hidden layers with 128 units each. Run the next cell to train the network and see the learning curves.

# In[6]:


model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='mae',
)
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),
    batch_size=512,
    epochs=50,
)
history_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)
history_df.loc[:, ['loss', 'val_loss']].plot()
print("Minimum Validation Loss: {:0.4f}".format(history_df['val_loss'].min()));


# # 2) Add Capacity
# 
# What is your evaluation of these curves? Underfitting, overfitting, just right?

# In[7]:


# View the solution (Run this cell to receive credit!)
q_2.check()


# # 3) Define Early Stopping Callback
# 
# Now define an early stopping callback that waits 5 epochs (`patience'`) for a change in validation loss of at least `0.001` (`min_delta`) and keeps the weights with the best loss (`restore_best_weights`).

# In[8]:


from tensorflow.keras import callbacks

# YOUR CODE HERE: define an early stopping callback
early_stopping = callbacks.EarlyStopping(min_delta=0.001,patience=5, restore_best_weights=True )

# Check your answer
q_3.check()


# In[9]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#q_3.hint()
#q_3.solution()


# Now run this cell to train the model and get the learning curves. Notice the `callbacks` argument in `model.fit`.

# In[10]:


model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),    
    layers.Dense(1)
])
model.compile(
    optimizer='adam',
    loss='mae',
)
history = model.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    validation_data=(X_valid, y_valid),
    batch_size=512,
    epochs=50,
    callbacks=[early_stopping]
)
history_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)
history_df.loc[:, ['loss', 'val_loss']].plot()
print("Minimum Validation Loss: {:0.4f}".format(history_df['val_loss'].min()));


# # 4) Train and Interpret
# 
# Was this an improvement compared to training without early stopping?

# In[11]:


# View the solution (Run this cell to receive credit!)
q_4.check()


# If you like, try experimenting with `patience` and `min_delta` to see what difference it might make.
